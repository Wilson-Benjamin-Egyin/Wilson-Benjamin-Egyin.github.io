**1. Voltage Surge Estimation in Inverter-Cable-High-Impedance Load System**
*Journal of Power, Energy, and Control (2025)* **Abstract:** This paper derives analytical expressions to estimate peak terminal voltage surges. Results show surges can reach 200% of the DC link value when rise time is less than 3x propagation delay.
